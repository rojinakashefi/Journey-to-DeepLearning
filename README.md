# Journey to DeepLearning

The repository includes the following computer vision and deep learning topics implemented using PyTorch:

1. Object Localization: Localize and identify objects within images by predicting bounding boxes and their corresponding classes.

2. Image Segmentation: Divide images into segments or regions based on different criteria, such as color or texture, to extract object boundaries or specific regions of interest.

3. Neural Style Transfer: Combine the content of one image with the artistic style of another to create visually appealing outputs using deep neural networks.

4. Siamese Network: Learn to compare and identify similarities between pairs of inputs, commonly used for tasks like face recognition or image similarity matching.

5. GradCAM: Visualize the important regions in an image that contribute to a specific class prediction made by a deep neural network.

6. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN): Use a generator and discriminator to generate synthetic data samples that resemble real data, often employed for image generation and data augmentation.

7. Facial Expression Recognition: Analyze facial images or videos to detect and classify different facial expressions, such as happiness, sadness, or anger.

Additionally, the repository also provides implementations for the following tasks with Tensorflow:

8. Visualizing Filters of a CNN: Gain insights into how a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) processes and represents input data by examining the learned features or patterns captured by its filters.

9. Optimize TensorFlow Models for Deployment with TensorRT: Accelerate and optimize TensorFlow models for efficient deployment using TensorRT, a deep learning inference optimizer and runtime library provided by NVIDIA.

10. Fine-Tune BERT for Text Classification: Adapt the pre-trained BERT language model for text classification tasks by training it on task-specific data using TensorFlow. BERT is known for its strong performance in various natural language processing tasks.
